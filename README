= My Language Specs =
These language specifications are used by gtksourceview-2.0 for syntax highlighting, and gtksourceview-2.0 is used by gedit.

= Info =

http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtksourceview/stable/lang-tutorial.html

= Installation ==

The default location for the language definition files is /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/. To avoid the risk of overwriting them during upgrades (or to avoid overwriting the originals in case you want to switch back), you might want to place them in ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/.

If you're cloning this Git repo and you want to keep it in a more handy location, you can also create a file system link using "ln -s path/to/My-Language-Specs/ ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs".
