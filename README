= My Language Specs =
These language specifications are used by gtksourceview-2.0 for syntax highlighting, and gtksourceview-2.0 is used by gedit.

= Info =

http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtksourceview/stable/lang-tutorial.html

= Installation ==

The default location for the language definition files is /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/. To avoid the risk of overwriting them during upgrades (or to avoid overwriting the originals in case you want to switch back), you might want to place them in ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/.

If you're cloning this Git repo and you want to keep it in a more handy location, you can also create a file system link using "ln -s path/to/My-Language-Specs/ ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs".

In Ubuntu 11.10 and up, your paths will need to be gtksourceview-3.0 instead of gtksourceview-2.0.

= Changes =

I modified some of the original *.lang files to better suit my needs. Here is a list of some of my modifications:

== css.lang ==

Nothing yet.

== def.lang ==

Added new code tags NOTE and FYI.
Added chrome:// and file:// URI protocols.

== javascript.lang ==

Added keywords for Firebug console functions.

== html.lang ==

In the process of making it stricter to adhere to XHTML standards.
Turned off spellcheck for attribute values.

== python.lang ==

Added highlighting for "logging" (the logging module) and "logger" (a common variable name for logging instances).
pdb and ipdb are highlighted as errors, making it easier to find your debug statements.

== xml.lang ==

Turned off spellcheck for attribute values.
